# Advanced Functional Programming in Haskell - Labs  

This repository contains solutions and advanced implementations for a series of functional programming problems, solved in Haskell. The code was developed as part of the **Functional Programming** course and demonstrates the ability to apply advanced concepts such as monads, functors, lazy evaluation, and deep recursion.  

## Project Contents  

- **Monads and Lazy Evaluation** - Using the `Maybe`, `IO`, and `Reader` monads to handle side effects and controlled computations.  
- **Functors and Applicative** - Implementing and utilizing functions like `fmap`, `pure`, and `(<*>)` to demonstrate the power of functional composition.  
- **Expression Evaluation and Evaluation Trees** - Defining custom types for mathematical expressions and evaluating them using abstract syntax trees.  
- **Logic Problems and Boolean Expression Evaluation** - Defining logical operators and evaluating logical expressions within a controlled environment (type `Prop`).  
- **Data Structures and Custom Classes** - Implementing search trees, vectors, collections, and other custom structures using Haskell classes such as `Collection`, `ArbInfo`, and `GeoOps`.  
- **Functional Transformation of Lists** - Using higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `foldr`, and `foldl` for data manipulation and computational optimization.  

## Demonstrated Concepts  

- **Advanced Recursion** - Solving problems using deep and optimized recursion.  
- **Lazy Evaluation Paradigm** - Delayed execution of computations for improved efficiency.  
- **Composition and Higher-Order Functions** - Utilizing functional composition to solve problems.  
- **Code Abstraction and Reusability** - Using type classes and instances to abstract behavior and reuse functional logic.  
- **Managing Side Effects** - Employing monads and types like `IO` to control side effects and user interaction.  

## Purpose  

- **Pure Functional Evaluation**  
- **Advanced Type Manipulation**  
- **Modularity and Abstraction Concepts in Haskell**  

This code can serve as a learning foundation for those who want to understand and deepen their knowledge of applied functional programming in Haskell.
